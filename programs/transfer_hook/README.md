# Transfer Hook Program

## Overview

The Transfer Hook Program is a Solana-based smart contract that facilitates custom actions or validations during token transfers. It allows users to define hooks that execute specific logic when a token transfer occurs.

## Features:

- **Custom Actions:** Define and execute custom actions during token transfers.
- **Validation Logic:** Implement validation logic before allowing or rejecting token transfers.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** Add additional functionality to token transfers based on specific criteria.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/installation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bark-community/bark-token-program/programs/transfer_hook.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd programs && transfer_hook
   ```

3. Build the program:

   ```bash
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

4. Deploy the program:

   ```bash
   solana deploy target/deploy/transfer_hook.so
   ```

## Usage

1. Integrate the transfer hook into your Solana 2022 token program.

2. Define custom actions or validation logic in the transfer hook.

3. Execute token transfers to observe the custom behavior defined by the transfer hook.
